# Homework 1 Specific Information

Q1 should take less than 5 seconds to run with all the code implemented.
Q2 should take less than 30 seconds to run *one* exploration algorithm with one hyperparameter.



# Library Setup

We include a requirements.txt file to make the installation of
dependencies easy. We recommend using a conda environment for all homeworks.
Note that we may change the required python version for different homeworks.
If you are not familiar with conda you can read more about it here:
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

1. Create a conda environment (where n is the homework number):
```
conda create -n HWn python=3.10.12
```

2. activate the environment
```
conda activate HWn
```

3. install the packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
